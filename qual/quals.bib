    abstract = {Abstract For the last 15 years, super-resolution (SR) algorithms have successfully been applied to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to increase the spatial resolution of scans after acquisition has been performed, thus facilitating the doctors' diagnosis. The variety of application and techniques has grown ever since, especially in the MRI modality, showing the interest of the community to such postacquisition processing. This article presents a review of the general principle of SR as well as how this principle has been adapted to MRI data. The main algorithms and the principal acquisition protocols are detailed for both static and moving subjects. The presented strategies are discussed and compared according to the data specificities. Later, different ways of measuring the resolution enhancement and quantify the benefit of SR are detailed. Finally, unexplored perspectives on the application of SR to MRI data are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson Part A 40A: 306–325, 2012.},

Conventional deconvolution techniques are limited in their ability to recover features in imaging data by the Shannon–Nyquist sampling theorem. Here, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN) on a sample of 4550 images of nearby galaxies at 0.01 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.02 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and conduct 10× cross-validation to evaluate the results. We present a method using a GAN trained on galaxy images that can recover features from artificially degraded images with worse seeing and higher noise than the original with a performance that far exceeds simple deconvolution. The ability to better recover detailed features such as galaxy morphology from low signal to noise and low angular resolution imaging data significantly increases our ability to study existing data sets of astrophysical objects as well as future observations with observatories such as the Large Synoptic Sky Telescope (LSST) and the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes.}",

The average resolution of very-long- and very-short-exposure images is studied in terms of the phase- and log-amplitude-structure functions, whose sum we call the ``wave-structure function.'' Those results which are comparable are in agreement with the findings of Hufnagel and Stanley who studied the average modulation transfer function of long-exposure images. It is found that the average short-exposure resolution can be significantly better than the average long-exposure resolution, but only if the wave distortion does not include substantial intensity variation.},

    abstract = "Optical flow cannot be computed locally, since only one independent measurement is available from the image sequence at a point, while the flow velocity has two components. A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

Several image registration methods which were used to estimate the position and orientation differences between these low resolution images are tested in this study. It was found that the Fourier method is superior to other methods. The non-uniform interpolation method is then used to reconstruct vehicle license plate images from images with a character size as small as 3 × 6 pixels. Results show that although the number or character is still not easy to read, the reconstructed image shows a better readability than the original image.},

@techreport{Alam2000,
    abstract = {Forward looking infrared (FLIR) detector arrays generally produce spatially undersampled images because the FLIR arrays cannot be made dense enough to yield a sufficiently high spatial sampling frequency. Multi-frame techniques, such as microscanning, are an effective means of reducing aliasing and increasing resolution in images produced by staring imaging systems. These techniques involve interlacing a set of image frames that have been shifted with respect to each other during acquisition. The FLIR system is mounted on a moving platform, such as an aircraft, and the vibrations associated with the platform are used to generate the shifts. Since a fixed number of image frames is required, and the shifts are random, the acquired frames will not fall on a uniformly spaced grid. Furthermore, some of the acquired frames may have almost similar shifts thus making them unusable for high-resolution image reconstruction. In this paper, we utilize a gradient-based registration algorithm to estimate the shifts between the acquired frames and then use a weighted nearest-neighbor approach for placing the frames onto a uniform grid to form a final high-resolution image. Blurring by the detector and optics of the imaging system limits the increase in image resolution when microscanning is attempted at sub-pixel movements of less than half the detector width. We resolve this difficulty by the application of the Wiener filter, designed using the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the imaging system, to the high-resolution image. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The techniques proposed herein are significantly faster than alternate techniques, and are found to be especially suitable for real-time applications.},

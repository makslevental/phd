    abstract = {Abstract For the last 15 years, super-resolution (SR) algorithms have successfully been applied to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to increase the spatial resolution of scans after acquisition has been performed, thus facilitating the doctors' diagnosis. The variety of application and techniques has grown ever since, especially in the MRI modality, showing the interest of the community to such postacquisition processing. This article presents a review of the general principle of SR as well as how this principle has been adapted to MRI data. The main algorithms and the principal acquisition protocols are detailed for both static and moving subjects. The presented strategies are discussed and compared according to the data specificities. Later, different ways of measuring the resolution enhancement and quantify the benefit of SR are detailed. Finally, unexplored perspectives on the application of SR to MRI data are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson Part A 40A: 306–325, 2012.},

    abstract = "{Observations of astrophysical objects such as galaxies are limited by various sources of random and systematic noise from the sky background, the optical system of the telescope and the detector used to record the data. Conventional deconvolution techniques are limited in their ability to recover features in imaging data by the Shannon–Nyquist sampling theorem. Here, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN) on a sample of 4550 images of nearby galaxies at 0.01 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.02 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and conduct 10× cross-validation to evaluate the results. We present a method using a GAN trained on galaxy images that can recover features from artificially degraded images with worse seeing and higher noise than the original with a performance that far exceeds simple deconvolution. The ability to better recover detailed features such as galaxy morphology from low signal to noise and low angular resolution imaging data significantly increases our ability to study existing data sets of astrophysical objects as well as future observations with observatories such as the Large Synoptic Sky Telescope (LSST) and the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes.}",

    abstract = {A theoretical foundation is developed for relating the statistics of wave distortion to optical resolution. The average resolution of very-long- and very-short-exposure images is studied in terms of the phase- and log-amplitude-structure functions, whose sum we call the ``wave-structure function.'' Those results which are comparable are in agreement with the findings of Hufnagel and Stanley who studied the average modulation transfer function of long-exposure images. It is found that the average short-exposure resolution can be significantly better than the average long-exposure resolution, but only if the wave distortion does not include substantial intensity variation.},

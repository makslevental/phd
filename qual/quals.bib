    abstract = {Abstract For the last 15 years, super-resolution (SR) algorithms have successfully been applied to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to increase the spatial resolution of scans after acquisition has been performed, thus facilitating the doctors' diagnosis. The variety of application and techniques has grown ever since, especially in the MRI modality, showing the interest of the community to such postacquisition processing. This article presents a review of the general principle of SR as well as how this principle has been adapted to MRI data. The main algorithms and the principal acquisition protocols are detailed for both static and moving subjects. The presented strategies are discussed and compared according to the data specificities. Later, different ways of measuring the resolution enhancement and quantify the benefit of SR are detailed. Finally, unexplored perspectives on the application of SR to MRI data are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson Part A 40A: 306–325, 2012.},

Conventional deconvolution techniques are limited in their ability to recover features in imaging data by the Shannon–Nyquist sampling theorem. Here, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN) on a sample of 4550 images of nearby galaxies at 0.01 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.02 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and conduct 10× cross-validation to evaluate the results. We present a method using a GAN trained on galaxy images that can recover features from artificially degraded images with worse seeing and higher noise than the original with a performance that far exceeds simple deconvolution. The ability to better recover detailed features such as galaxy morphology from low signal to noise and low angular resolution imaging data significantly increases our ability to study existing data sets of astrophysical objects as well as future observations with observatories such as the Large Synoptic Sky Telescope (LSST) and the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes.},

The average resolution of very-long- and very-short-exposure images is studied in terms of the phase- and log-amplitude-structure functions, whose sum we call the ``wave-structure function.'' Those results which are comparable are in agreement with the findings of Hufnagel and Stanley who studied the average modulation transfer function of long-exposure images. It is found that the average short-exposure resolution can be significantly better than the average long-exposure resolution, but only if the wave distortion does not include substantial intensity variation.},

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

This is particularly true for many in-frared focal plane arrays. Thus, the resulting images may be severely aliased. This paper examines a technique for estimating a high-resolution image, with reduced aliasing, from a sequence of undersampled frames. Several approaches to this problem have been investigated previously. However, in this paper a maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for jointly estimating image registration parameters and the high-resolution image is presented. Several previous approaches have relied on knowing the registration parameters a priori or have utilized registration techniques not specifically designed to treat severely aliased images. In the proposed method, the registration parameters are iteratively updated along with the high-resolution image in a cyclic coordinate-descent optimization procedure. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed MAP algorithm using both visible and infrared images. Quantitative error analysis is provided and several images are shown for subjective evaluation.},

 principles of probability theory. Starting from the basics
 of probability, the authors develop the theory of
 statistical inference using techniques, definitions, and
 concepts that are statistical and are natural extensions
 and consequences of previous concepts. Intended for
 first-year graduate students, this book can be used for
 students majoring in statistics who have a solid
 mathematics background. It can also be used in a way that
 stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
 being more concerned with understanding basic statistical
 concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for
 a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal
 optimality investigations. }},

    abstract = {A constrained optimization type of numerical algorithm for removing noise from images is presented. The total variation of the image is minimized subject to constraints involving the statistics of the noise. The constraints are imposed using Lanrange multipliers. The solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold determined by the constraints. As t → ∞ the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the image back onto the constraint set.},

    abstract = {Consider an underdetermined system of linear equations y = Ax with known y and d { \ { } $\backslash$texttimes { \ } } n matrix A. We seek the nonnegative x with the fewest nonzeros satisfying y = Ax. In general, this problem is NP-hard. However, for many matrices A there is a threshold phenomenon: if the sparsest solution is sufficiently sparse, it can be found by linear programming. We explain this by the theory of convex polytopes. Let aj denote the jth column of A, 1 { \textless } = j { \textless } = n, let a 0 = 0 and P denote the convex hull of the aj . We say the polytope P is outwardly k-neighborly if every subset of k vertices not including 0 spans a face of P. We show that outward k-neighborliness is equivalent to the statement that, whenever y = Ax has a nonnegative solution with at most k nonzeros, it is the nonnegative solution to y = Ax having minimal sum. We also consider weak neighborliness, where the overwhelming majority of k-sets of aj s not containing 0 span a face of P. This implies that most nonnegative vectors x with k nonzeros are uniquely recoverable from y = Ax by linear programming. Numerous corollaries follow by invoking neighborliness results. For example, for most large n by 2n underdetermined systems having a solution with fewer nonzeros than roughly half the number of equations, the sparsest solution can be found by linear programming.},

    abstract = {This paper deals with the single image scale-up problem us- ing sparse-representation modeling. The goal is to recover an original image from its blurred and down-scaled noisy version. Since this problem is highly ill-posed, a prior is needed in order to regularize it. The liter- ature offers various ways to address this problem, ranging from simple linear space-invariant interpolation schemes (e.g., bicubic interpolation), to spatially-adaptive and non-linear filters of various sorts. We embark from a recently-proposed successful algorithm by Yang et. al. [1,2], and similarly assume a local Sparse-Land model on image patches, serving as regularization. Several important modifications to the above-mentioned solution are introduced, and are shown to lead to improved results. These modifications include amajor simplification of the overall process both in terms of the computational complexity and the algorithm architecture, using a different training approach for the dictionary-pair, and introduc- ing the ability to operate without a training-set by boot-strapping the scale-up task from the given low-resolution image. We demonstrate the results on true images, showing both visual and PSNR improvements.},

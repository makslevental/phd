\title{Super Resolution for Automated Target Recognition}
\author{Maksim Levental}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	Super resolution is the process of producing high-resolution images from low-resolution images while preserving ground truth about the subject matter of the images and potentially inferring more such truth.
	%
	Algorithms that successfully carry out such a process are broadly useful in all circumstances where high-resolution imagery is either difficult or impossible to obtain.
	%
	In particular we look towards super resolving images collected using longwave infrared cameras since high resolution sensors for such cameras do not currently exist.
	%
	We present an exposition of motivations and concepts of super resolution in general and current techniques, with a qualitative comparison of such techniques.
	%
	Finally we suggest directions for future research.

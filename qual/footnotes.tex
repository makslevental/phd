\anotecontent{vbsuper}{We will often use the verb form "to super resolve" in order to denote the use of one or more such methods.}
\anotecontent{rayleighscriterion}{The amplitude of the diffraction pattern (known as the Airy pattern) of a monochromatic point source through a circular aperture is given by \[I(\theta)=I_{0}\left[{\frac {2J_{1}(ka\sin \theta )}{ka\sin \theta }}\right]^{2}\] where $I_0$ is peak intensity (at the center), $k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number of the light, $\theta$ is the angle of observation, and $J_1$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one\cite{goodman2005introduction}. It is maxima/minima of this function that Rayleigh's criterion concerns.}
\anotecontent{shotnoise}{TODO}
\anotecontent{satelliteoptics}{Rayleigh's criterion implies that the angular resolution $R$ of a telescope with optical diameter $D = 2.4\text{m}$ observing visible light (${\sim}500\text{nm}$) is approximately\cite{doi:10.1080.14786447908639684} \[R  \approx 1.220\frac{\lambda}{D} = 1.220 \frac{500\text{nm}}{2.4\text{m}} \approx 0.06 \text{arcsec}\] From an altitude of 250 km this corresponds to a ground sample distance of 6cm. This loss of resolving power is further exacerbated by refraction through turbulent atmosphere\cite{Fried:66}.}
\anotecontent{subpixel}{For example when a point source wholly captured by one sensor element shifts to distributing energy equally amongst the same element and a direct adjacent.}

\anotecontent{lexico}{Consider an $N$ row $\times$ $M$ column image $X(n, m)$. The column-major vectorization $bm{x}$ of the image is the $NM$ length vector defined as $\bm{x}(Mm + n) = X(n, m)$.}
\anotecontent{patch}{$m \times m$ pixel window, e.g. $3 \times 3$.}
\anotecontent{tensor}{A multidimensional array\cite{Goodfellow:2016:DL:3086952}. Not to be confused with the algebraic object.}
%\anotecontent{deep-depletion}{The depletion layer is the region at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface that is characterized by few charge carriers (electrons and holes) that occurs when a gate voltage higher than the flat-band voltage is applied. Deep-depletion is characterized by a depletion region width that is greater than that at equilibrium\cite{semiconductorbook}.}
%\anotecontent{inversion}{The term inversion means that the surface is inverted from P type to N type, or electron rich. This process is a slow thermal equilibration\cite{ccdarkcurrent}, is called dark current and at various temperatures/exposure times is a source of noise.}
\anotecontent{depletion}{By applying a positive voltage to the gate holes are repelled and migrate through the body to ground. This leaves a depleted region near the Si-SiO$_2$ interface that acts as an insulator.}
\anotecontent{buriedchannel}{Buried channel as distinct from surface channel. In surface channel MOS capacitors signal charge is stored at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface, which can lead to charge trapping during the charge transfer process\cite{Bass:2009:HOT:1594759}.}
\anotecontent{ccd}{CCD arrays, for example, employ $2\times 2$ or $3\times 3$ pixel binning, which is the practice of collapsing windows of pixels down to one pixel.}
\anotecontent{pnjunction}{The interface between a p-type semiconductor (excess holes, i.e. positive charge carriers) and an n-type (excess electrons, i.e. negative charge carriers) semiconductor.}
\anotecontent{reversebias}{With the p-type material at a lower voltage than the n-type.
%
This causes both the holes and the electrons to flow away from the junction creating a depletion zone.}
\anotecontent{bolometer}{Late 19th century: from Greek bolÄ“ 'ray of light' + -meter.}
\anotecontent{mems}{Micro-electro-mechanical systems.}
\anotecontent{fabryperot}{An optical cavity made from two parallel reflecting surfaces that passes light only when it is in resonance with the cavity.}

\anotecontent{innerphotoelectric}{The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons when light hits a material.
%
The inner photoelectric effect is that phenomenon in the bulk matter of semiconductors.}
\anotecontent{opticalflow}{"Optical flow can also be defined as the distribution of apparent velocities of movement of [patterns] in an image."\cite{HORN1981185}}
\anotecontent{otf}{The optical transfer function is the spatial Fourier transform of the point spread function (the impulse response) of the optics. Spatial here means periodic in space rather than in time.}
\anotecontent{coma}{Off-axis point sources appearing to have a tail (coma), due to variation in magnification in the image of the aperture stop.}
\anotecontent{dispersion}{E.g. the cover of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon.}
\anotecontent{fnumber}{The ratio of the system's focal length to the diameter of the aperture.}

\anotecontent{lsi}{In analogy with Linear Time Invariant (i.e. linear and constant in space).}
\anotecontent{lrpixel}{An LR pixel is one sampled from an LR image and embedded in an HR grid.

\anotecontent{noise}{Noise here doesn't necessarily mean unwanted high frequency variation but simply a source of randomness.
%
This is in close affinity with how generative machines such as variational auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks are understood.}
%
\anotecontent{gpassumptions}{Namely $\bm{y}_1$ is distributed $(0, W)$-Normal and independent of $\eta_1$.}
\anotecontent{kalmanprediction}{This is better understood in the more general linear dynamic systems case where $\bm{y}_k = A_k\bm{y}_k + B_k \bm{u}_k + \varepsilon_k$ and $B_k \bm{u}_k$ is known "controlled" input.
%
Then the prediction includes a $B_k \bm{u}_{k-1}$ term and the Kalman gain effectively mediates between controlled and uncontrolled inputs.
}
\anotecontent{hmrf}{A Markov random field (MRF) is a collection of random variables $x_i, y_j, \mathellipsis$ with conditional dependence represented by pairings and satisfying the \textit{pairwise Markov} property: any two random variables that aren't paired are conditionally independent of each other given (conditioned on) all other variables.
%
A \textit{hidden} Markov random field is simply a MRF where some of the random variables aren't observed.

%
Conjugate gradient descent is gradient descent but with conjugate gradients (it has better convergence properties).
}
\anotecontent{illcondition}{The condition number $\kappa$ of a function is a measure of how sensitive it is to small perturbations; for a matrix $G$ it is defined $\kappa (G) \coloneqq \sigma_{\max}(G)/\sigma_{\min} (G)$ where $\sigma_{\max}(G), \sigma_{\min} (G)$ are the maximum and minimum singular values of $G$ respectively.}
\anotecontent{precondition}{A pre-conditioner of a matrix $G$ is an approximation of $G$ that has a better condition number.
%
Nguyen \textit{et al.} propose a pre-conditioner with singular values clustered around 1 in order that $\kappa(G) \approx 1$.}
